## Talking Pictures

##### by Mark Collins and Duy Thanh Vu

Movie Tracker is a partner project assigned over a nine-day period in mod three at Turing School in Denver, CO. Our iteration is called Talking Pictures as an homage to the movie euphemism and also because it fosters conversations about movies.

The project represents our first time implementing React Router and Redux, as well as cementing a better understanding of previous concepts.

### Intall/Setup

- `run npm install`
- `run npm start`
- direct your browswer to localhost:3000

Instructions: Browse movies by categories provided in the navigation bar, click on movie posters in the display area for additonal details or login to favorite selected movies for later.

## Learning goals

Having learned React Redux and Router the day before starting the project, our primary goal was the grasp the logic and syntax of these new frameworks. Talking Pictures represents the ideal project scope to understand the benefit of Redux and Router when working with larger codebases. 

Given the pace of Turing School's instruction, we also set out to further cement our understanding of core concepts learned in previous modules. This includes, but is in no way limited to: React, making and breaking out fetch calls, testing with Jest and Enzyme, as well as taking advantage of SCSS functionality.

#### Biggest Wins

Teamwork played a large role in the sucess of Talking Pictures. With a tenuous grasp of React's frameworks we came together to support each other and by building out the files together we filled in the gaps as a team. Similarly, as the project coallesced we understood the need to break out into smaller groups to accomplish more in the limited time given and then came together to help each other understand the code we'd written on our own.

Our biggest technical win was on day three when we spent hours chasing the ability for users to login and after asking for help and working with fellow classmates we sequestered ourselves and step-by-step walking through the code necessary we saw our new user show up on our local server and many high fives were shared.

#### Biggest Struggle

Day eight was filled with frustration, with the project due in less than 36 hours we struggled to reach the second iteration of functionality. After brainstorming and overthinking a great deal of processes we asked for help and still couldn't get it to work. Forcing ourselves to pause for poise, the solution — a syntactic misunderstnding of Redux — provided progress and better comprehension of how Redux operates. The ensuing capacity to manipulate Redux allowed us to work through further functionality.
